# Homework 3
### About
In this homework, we are asked to implement (fill in blanks) some classic CV algorithms like `Hough Transformation`, `Canny Edge detection`, 
and `SIFT`.

### Note
Make sure the convolution function you implement is correct. It is widely used in those algorithms.

### Some work demo
