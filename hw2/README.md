# Homework 2
### About
This homework is just some coding problems regarding the frequently used packages like `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `MatPlotlib` and `Pytorch`.

### About loss
In the `Pytorch` part, we used three kinds of losses `crossEntropy`, `l1`, and `MSE`. Note that the `crossEntropy` is implemented without requiring the predictions
and labels to have equal size. But for the rest two, they need **one hot encoding** to make sure the output and labels have equal size.
