# Homework 4: Machine Learning
### About
In this homework, we are asked to implement some baisc machine learning algorithms including `PCA`, `K-menas`, `Logisitic Regression`, `Linear Regression`.

### Notice
The code for `MNIST Implementation` part is not completely correct. I tried to follow the slides, but the result is wrong. Give up :(

### About Honor Code
JI students who take ECE4880J should not directly copy these code or modify them. The code is only for reference, and its correctness cannot be garanteed as well.
If the JI Honor Council spot copying behavior, it is not the author's responsibilty.
